Leveraging\nLangchain's openai function chain, the system\naccurately extracts details like name, contact, skills,\nprojects, and job descriptions. This improves precision\nin matching candidates with job requirements,\nstreamlining recruitment for targeted shortlisting, and\noptimizing efficiency, saving valuable time and\nresources.LLmops Best practice, Worked on improving traditional\nRAG systems, replacing Traditional RAG systems using\nRerankers, RAG Fusion, Dynamic Chunking, Multi\nQuery Retrieval, Prompt optimization, Comprehensive\nembedding test to ensure optimal performance,\nEvaluation of Indexing algorithms.\nE D U C A T I O N\nI n d o r e \t I n s t i t u t e \t o f \t S c i e n c e \t a n d \t T e c h n o l o g y , \t I n d o r e \t\nB.Tech (Mechanical Engineer)  Designed and implemented a cutting-edge Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages a\nKnowledge Graph instead of a traditional Vector\nDatabase. This approach enhances the capabilities of\nthe Language Model (LLM) Agent, enabling it to\nproficiently respond to analytical questions and tackle\nmultihop queries\nCreated a backend pipeline that can analyze and verify\nspeech videos using an LLM and a SOTA vison model.\nThe system can take a speech video file as input and\nuses llm and vision model to generate insights such as\nthe points discussed, suggestions made by audiences,\nspeaker name, and number of people attending the\nsession. The system also implements a self check system\nthat can compare the generated fields with the original\nvideo and run inference again if they are not correct\nDesigned a multi-agent system tailored for financial\napplications, leveraging LangChain agent, created system  \nto seamlessly translate natural language queries into SQL\nqueries. Managed data retrieval from diverse database\ntables, facilitating insightful responses and graphical\nrepresentations for users in an innovative manner",
